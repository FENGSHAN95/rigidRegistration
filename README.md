# Rigid Registration Package

This project was to create a better rigid registration method for use in electron microscopy (EM). Here is the result of our project, with all necessary python files included. We also created a Graphic User Interphase (GUI) with tools to help make registration easier to visualize and check. [Insert stuff about lab group.]

### Getting Started

To get started, download the entire main branch. It will download as a zip file. Extract everything to a new file location of your choice. From there, you can open the Installation Guide.pdf to finish getting set up and run the program.
